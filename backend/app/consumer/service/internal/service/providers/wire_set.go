// This file defines the dependency injection ProviderSet for the service layer and contains no business logic.
// The build tag `wireinject` excludes this source from normal `go build` and final binaries.
// Run `go generate ./...` or `go run github.com/google/wire/cmd/wire` to regenerate the Wire output (e.g. `wire_gen.go`), which will be included in final builds.
// Keep provider constructors here only; avoid init-time side effects or runtime logic in this file.
